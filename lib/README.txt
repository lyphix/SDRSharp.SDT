IMPORTANT

To develop new plugins using the Telerik Windows Forms toolkit, you will need a license from Progress Telerik.

Check their nice offerings: https://www.telerik.com/products/winforms.aspx

Plain Windows Forms Plugins are still supported by the application in case you need something simple.

The dependencies must be copied to the "lib" directory.
